# Walmart+ Refund
This bot will log into your Walmart + Accounts and live chat to someone for a refund. This is useful because some people register for Walmart +
right before a PS5 drop, and then want to cancel it afterwards. Since they run thousands of accounts, it is a pain to go through manually. This is when
a bot like this comes in handy!
